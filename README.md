#Austin Crime Reports 2022
Question 1: Seeing if there is a trend of when crimes are being reported during the day, and then throughout the year.

Using the data set of Austin Crime reports in 2022. We focused on the data in the columns of Occurred Time and Occurred Date.

For the first part of the question, we looked at the data for Occurred Time. Which represents the time of when a crime is being reported. We wanted to see if there was a trend of when crimes are being reported. 

We can see a trend of when crime reports are being made. The number of reports peaks early in the day, 1:00-3:00 am and then again late in the afternoon, 5:00-6:00 pm. 
Which if we think about human patterns. It makes sense that crimes are happening in the middle of the night. Then maybe happening in the middle of the day, but being reported once people get off of work. When they come home to realize a crime has been reported. 

For the second part of the question, we looked at the data for Occurred Date. Which represents the day of which a report was created. Similarly to looking at the trend for reports throughout the day, we wanted to see what the trend for reports was like for the year. 
Based on the data we can see that the reports are peaking in the middle of the year. This shocked us, you always hear about crime spiking over the holidays
